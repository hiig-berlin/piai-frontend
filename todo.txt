- Menu button. The button is actually of a good size. But the SVG is funny. 
Could you double check, that the artboard is closely fitting and best a square
(for the rounded and neg version)

- Confirm that Matomo tracks referral correctly
  
- Use local google fonts? Add TypeKit into imprint

- Check TODOs: in other files I've got some questions ...

- VVU: I added new JumpAnchor component (it's in use in TextSection). 
  > The "id" is the jump anchor. 
  > If you load a page with a hash bang "#!" after page transition the site will soft scroll to the location
    e.g http://localhost:3000/#!more
  > I've changed the #textSection to #more (also in the CMS)
