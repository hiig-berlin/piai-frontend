Legal interventions must be complemented by the countervailing power of civil society, namely of consumer organizations and individual consumers.

We envision a paradigm shift, where artificial intelligence technologies are brought to the side of consumers and their organizations, with the aim of building an efficient and effective counter-power.

We are familiar with the principles stated in some of these guidelines (EU, OpenAI, Google) and our systems are designed to always keep a human in the loop and provide explainability of the results and transparency on the technology and methodology used to develop our models.",,"Collaboration","We listen, ask questions, seek feedback and co-create solutions with our partners — because contextual knowledge is just as crucial for lasting impact as effective documentation technology. When a useful strategy or technological development arises during the course of a project, we take strides to make it openly available, because the human rights movement is strengthened by exchange. ","Purpose","Information management is not an end unto itself. Evidence, law and research are tools to achieve real-world impact for human rights. That’s why we support our partners to clearly define the goal of their project—how will it advance human rights on the ground?—to ensure that the technologies or strategies selected always serve that ultimate purpose. ","Safety","Human rights defenders frequently work with sensitive information or in risky environments — or collaborate with someone who does — so safety is of the utmost importance. We guide our partners through participatory threat assessments, recommend context-appropriate measures to stay safe, and regularly audit our own tools for vulnerabilities. All of the software that we develop is open source, meaning the code is available for anyone to examine. ","Humanity","We believe that information solutions are most valuable when they are designed with people’s goals and behaviours in mind. Furthermore, technology exists in service to human rights defenders, not the other way around. As such, real-world interactions are at the heart of everything we do. We develop solutions and evolve our tools based not on assumptions, but on the ways that human rights defenders actually put them to use.","Adaptability","At HURIDOCS, we practice the agile methodology of software development and project management. This means that we iterate to find a solution and adapt to changing conditions, even if it results in deviating from the original plan. Why? Because when we incorporate newly discovered information or lessons learned along the way, we obtain better results for our partners — and for the human rights movement.

We collaborate with local activist groups, national human rights institutions, large international NGOs and many organisations in between. Some of our partners specialise in specific issues such as arbitrary arrest, freedom of expression, women and girls’ rights, the rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, reducing inequalities, climate action, historical memory, and transitional justice, while others focus on human rights-related mechanisms such as the United Nations Human Rights Treaty System.

In the exploratory stage of the project, we have collected over 10 million (20 TB) offshore images by outdoor, GPS-enabled action cameras. We developed an artificial intelligence object detection algorithm which automatically scans the images for floating macroplastic items. All object detections are filtered for false positives by a team of volunteers, before being aggregated into georeferenced numerical density data. In this session, we present findings from the exploratory data, as well as the future development plans. When scaled up, ADIS has the potential to provide a more continuous and global database of macroplastic (>50 cm) sea surface concentrations.","Robin de Vries","Rotterdam","3014 JH","Netherlands","2021-01-01","Beta/Testing","The Ocean Cleanup Projects B.V.","Private","Donors and philantropy","3 persons",66,33,,,,,"Other",false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,true,"Environmental tech NGO","Computer Vision",false,true,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,,"Traditional Machine Learning (Linear Regression, CART, SVM, etc.), Deep Learning (CNN, Transformers, etc.)",true,true,false,false,,"Transfer Learning",false,false,false,false,true,false,false,,"Inhouse, External",true,true,false,,"No",,,,"A possible definition of public interest projects is that they contribute to a goal that benefits all citizens instead of a profit-driven or private goal.
